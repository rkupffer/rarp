Consider reading the tutorials in the following order:

1. [setup.md](./setup.md)
2. [ssh.md](./ssh.md)
3. [git.md](./git.md)
4. terminal.md (not started yet)[^1]
5. [connect.d](./connect.d)

[^1]: The `git` tutorial includes a couple of handy commands to operate with
  the command line. For now, those will do the trick.
